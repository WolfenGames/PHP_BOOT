<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------

We need this to set up a 4x4 matrices to handle transformation, translation,
and projection of our camera, objects.

Most of the class is setup and handled in construction.

The variables to be set are as follows ::

scale -> Value to scale
preset -> one of the constants
			IDENTITY
			scale
			RX
			RY
			RZ
			TRANSLATION
			PROJECTION
angle -> angle of the object / camera
vtc -> translation vector
fov -> field of view, how much do you want to see
ratio -> projected image ratio
near -> clipping plane closest to the camera
far -> distance clipping plane, away from the camera

To create a new matrix instance the following is an eg:
$P = new Matrix( array( 'preset' => Matrix::PROJECTION,
						'fov' => 60,
						'ratio' => 640/480,
						'near' => 1.0,
						'far' => -50.0 ) );

Functions availible::

Matrix mult( Matrix $v ) 

returns the multiplication of both matrices.

Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx )

returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
